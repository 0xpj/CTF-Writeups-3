# Challenge Title: Gross

## Description
Have you watched this movie??

Cipher: OQWKWPUVMYTIUSSTHHPI

Keep this: 12345 , will help you. Flag format: noob{FLAG}

## Solution
By reading the title I knew that it has something to do with the gronsfeld cipher

So, I tried to decode the cipher with [dcode fr](https://www.dcode.fr/gronsfeld-cipher) with encrytion key as `12345` (mentioned in the description)

we get the flag `noob{NOTGROSSITSGRONSFELD}`
