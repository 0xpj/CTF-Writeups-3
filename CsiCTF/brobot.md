## Description
```
This BoT can speak, can you ask him the flag? https://telegram.me/csictf_brobot/
```
PS: Bot taken down now

## Solution :

+ After a bit of experimentation, this gave out a [.wav](https://github.com/karma9874/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/CsiCTF/958977089.wav) file

```bash
' $(cat flag.txt) '
```
